Mimir Power-Up for Trello,
Is a simple time spend on a card, using start time and due time. Calculates the time difference between the two and puts a duration both on the card preview and details.

In the settings you can specify work day start and end times and whether you have paid breaks or a mix and the durations.

This gives Mimir the ability to calculate overtime.
